Basic Setup
-----------
After adding the prefab intro your project, you first need to adjust the ShivChat values, in that script you gona set:
-Server: The IRC Server IP or hostname
-Port: The default is 6667, set it to wharever you need.
-ServerPassword: (optional, use only if needed).
-Nick: this is the default nick, you can set it here, or change it later by using methods or messages.
-Use Identd: Identd server for nick (Optional, some IRC servers need it)

-Colors: There is: GeneralColor, PrivateColor, SystemColor and UserListColor, these are the colors to be used for those situacions.
The color can be specified in the traditional HTML format, you can refer to http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StyledText.html for options.

Then you have tab 1, tab 2, tab 3, tab 4, just leave be for now.

Tab Values:
After ShivChat is configured, next you need to configure each tab, look for child objects in "ShivChat->Canvas->Panel", 
there you must see Tab1, Tab2, Tab3, Tab4 and a few other objects.

Click on Tab1, there you will see the script "ShivChatTab" is attached to it, on it you will have:
-Tab Name : Here you will place the name of the tab, it will change ingame.
-Channel : This is the channel this tab will join in on the server
-ChannelPassword : optional, set if needed 
-Is Default: if this is marked as true, this tab will be the one active when the chat opens, you can have 1 or none as default.

Then you will have to do the same for the other tabs.

Removing a Tab
--------------
In order to remove, lets say, Tab4, from the chat you only need to do 2 things:
1) On ShivChat script, set Tab4 to null.
2) On "ShivChat->Canvas->Panel" de-activate Tab4 gameobject.

Adding a Tab:
-------------
This is more tricky, on the tab part clone any Tab, then move only its button, and on this button you gona need to add the 
"Component" gameobject of the tab you clone this from, and set it to disable like the others.

On the ShivChat script you gona need to add it manually to several places, just check where "_tab4" and "tab4" are used, 
you gona need to add the 5th tab to every one of these places.


Set Nick and Connect externally
-------------------------------
Generally you dont want the user to have to set its own nick and press connect, the simple way to do this is:
1) Disable "ShivChat->Canvas->Panel" "Connect" gameobject, that will remove the nick input and connect button.
2) Use "SendMessage()" or GetComponent to use a ShivChat method called "ExtConnect(New Nick)", that will send the nick and order it to connect,
   in the case you dont want to change the nick on this way, just call "Connect()".

The User block system:
----------------------
This is a simple string filter stored on a string list "blockedNicks" on ShivChat script, this list holds the nicks of the blocked users, if you want
to make the list permanent you will need to find a way to save the list somewhere, it may be a file or db on "OnApplicationQuit()", and them load it
on "Start()".

Chat Commands:
--------------
/hp list the commands
/pm nick something = Sends a private message to this user.
/bk nick = Add this user to your blocked list.
/rb nick = Remove this user from your blocked list.
/vb = Shows users in your blocked list.
